# C++ Vulkan Engine
Hello!

This is my first ever rendering engine! I've tried to keep the code clean and readable (Following vulkan-tutorial.com), and I intend to extend the renderer a lot more! (Eg, deferred rendering and multiple lights)

For physics, I'm using Bullet Physics, which is incredibly flexible and easy to use!

Feel free to read, use and modify this code however you'd like!
